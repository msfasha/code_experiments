msfasha: your thoughts about my thoughts regarding this project which I present in the readme file

GitHub Copilot: Here are focused suggestions to strengthen the plan and make it executable.

What to clarify
- Define hypotheses: what patterns do you expect and how will you test them (e.g., randomness, periodicity, change-points)?
- Define the time axis: Mushaf order vs. chronological (revelation) order. Also define windows (fixed N ayat, per surah, rolling windows).
- Decide normalization: with/without diacritics, and which orthography (Tanzil Uthmani vs. Simple). Keep both pipelines if you want to compare.
- Character mapping: Arabic is Unicode, not ASCII. Use Unicode code points or a custom stable mapping table. Document it.
- Muqatta’at analysis: specify null models (randomization, Markov-1 baselines) and statistical tests; avoid informal “CRC” claims—design falsifiable tests (e.g., parity, checksum functions) with multiple-testing control.

Data and tooling
- Source: Tanzil (pin exact file and version; Uthmani vs. Simple), optionally Quranic Arabic Corpus for morphology (check license).
- Preprocessing: Unicode normalization (NFKC), remove tatweel (U+0640), optional diacritics ranges (U+064B–U+065F, U+0670, U+06D6–U+06ED), normalize alef/hamza variants and ya/maqṣūra if required.
- Features:
  - Char-level: counts, proportions, run lengths, transitions, entropy rate.
  - Word-level: tokens, stems/lemmas (if using morphology), type-token ratio.
  - Muqatta’at: presence, positions, letter set properties vs. baselines.
- Methods: ACF/PACF on indicator series, spectral density, change-point detection, ARIMA/ARFIMA for numeric mappings, permutation tests, block bootstrap, information-theoretic measures (LZ compression, entropy).
- Reproducibility: lock data version, scripts to download, unit tests for known counts, record Unicode decisions.

Project structure (suggested)
- data/raw, data/processed
- src/ (preprocess, features, analysis)
- notebooks/ or Rmd/
- tests/
- scripts/ (download, build)

Questions
1) Will you analyze in R, Python, or both?  
2) Mushaf order or revelation order for the time series?  
3) Include diacritics, exclude, or run both pipelines?

If helpful, here is a tightened README draft you can drop in:

## Quran Quantitative Analyses

### Objectives
Analyze the Quran text as sequences to test for structure, regularity, and change over position:
- Character-level, selected-characters, word-level, and surah-level series.
- Windowed analyses (e.g., every 10 ayat), rolling windows, and per-surah summaries.
- Targeted analysis of the muqatta’at (e.g., Alif-Lam-Meem, Kaf-Ha-Ya-’Ayn-Sad), comparing observed patterns against null models.

### Key Design Choices
- Ordering: Mushaf (canonical) vs. chronological (revelation). Choose and document.
- Orthography: Tanzil “Uthmani” vs. “Simple”. Pin exact file and version.
- Diacritics: run both pipelines (with and without), documenting what is removed:
  - Tatweel (U+0640), diacritics (U+064B–U+065F, U+0670, U+06D6–U+06ED), and optional normalization of alef/hamza/ya/maqṣūra variants.
- Character mapping: use Unicode code points or a custom stable mapping table (not ASCII). Publish the mapping.

### Features to Extract
- Character-level: counts, proportions by ayah/window, run-lengths, transitions, entropy rate.
- Word-level: token counts, type-token ratio, stems/lemmas (if licensed data available).
- Muqatta’at: presence, letter-set properties, positions; compare to randomized/Markov baselines.

### Methods
- Time-series: ACF/PACF on indicator series, spectral analysis, change-point detection, ARIMA/ARFIMA on numeric encodings.
- Information-theoretic: entropy, compressibility (e.g., LZ).
- Validation: permutation tests, block bootstrap; control false discovery (Benjamini–Hochberg).

### Data Sources
- Tanzil: https://tanzil.net/download/ (pin file, version, and orthography).
- Optional: Quranic Arabic Corpus (for morphology; check license).

### Reproducibility
- Scripted data download and hashing.
- Unit tests for known verse/letter counts.
- Record Unicode normalization decisions and mapping table.

### Repository Layout (suggested)
- data/raw, data/processed
- src/ (preprocess/, features/, analysis/)
- notebooks/ or rmd/
- tests/
- scripts/

### Roadmap
1) Pin dataset and ordering; implement dual pipelines (with/without diacritics).
2) Build per-ayah dataframe with indices and basic counts.
3) Add sliding-window features; run baseline null-model comparisons.
4) Implement muqatta’at analyses with explicit hypotheses and tests.
5) Report results with effect sizes and corrected p-values; document limitations.
