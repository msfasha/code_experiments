The CRC/Hash hypothesis - I have a suspecion that the Muqatta'at (المقطعات - the disjointed letters at the start of certain surahs like ا ل م, كهيعص) in Quran servs as some kind of checksum is particularly intriguing. 
This is a novel computational angle that could yield interesting patterns.

- Basic statistics (mean, variance, trends over surah progression)
- Frequency domain analysis (FFT, spectral patterns)
- Autocorrelation and pattern repetition
- Information theory (entropy, compression ratios)
