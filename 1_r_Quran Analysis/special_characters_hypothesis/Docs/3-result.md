Perfect! I'll start implementing the Muqatta'at checksum analysis plan. Let me begin by creating the shared utilities module and then the individual analysis notebooks.

Perfect! I have successfully completed the comprehensive Muqatta'at checksum analysis project. Here's a summary of what has been implemented:

## âœ… Project Completion Summary

### **1. Shared Utilities Module (`data_utils.py`)**
- **QuranDataProcessor class** with comprehensive data handling
- **Basmala removal** from first ayah of each surah (with special handling for Surah 1)
- **Muqatta'at extraction** for all 29 relevant surahs
- **Letter frequency analysis** functions
- **Clean text accessor** methods for analysis

### **2. Four Specialized Analysis Notebooks**

#### **ðŸ“Š 01_basic_statistics.ipynb**
- Letter frequency distributions and statistical comparisons
- Surah length and character count analysis
- Correlation analysis between Muqatta'at and surah properties
- Comprehensive visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots)

#### **ðŸ§  02_information_theory.ipynb**
- **Shannon entropy** calculations for letter distributions
- **Compression ratio** analysis (gzip) before/after Muqatta'at removal
- **Redundancy analysis** and information content measurement
- **Checksum hypothesis testing** with mutual information and correlation analysis

#### **ðŸ“ˆ 03_frequency_domain.ipynb**
- **FFT analysis** to detect spectral patterns in letter sequences
- **Power spectral density** calculations with windowing
- **Dominant frequency** identification and spectral entropy
- **Spectral signature** comparisons between surahs with/without Muqatta'at

#### **ðŸ”„ 04_autocorrelation.ipynb**
- **Autocorrelation function** calculations for temporal pattern detection
- **Cross-correlation** analysis between Muqatta'at and surah content
- **Periodicity strength** and decay rate analysis
- **Peak detection** in autocorrelation functions

### **3. Key Features Implemented**

âœ… **Data Preprocessing**: Proper Basmala removal and Surah 1 handling  
âœ… **Statistical Analysis**: Comprehensive comparisons with significance testing  
âœ… **Information Theory**: Entropy, compression, and redundancy metrics  
âœ… **Frequency Domain**: FFT-based spectral analysis  
âœ… **Temporal Analysis**: Autocorrelation and cross-correlation patterns  
âœ… **Visualizations**: Rich plots for each analysis type  
âœ… **Statistical Testing**: T-tests, correlation analysis, and significance testing  

### **4. Analysis Capabilities**

Each notebook is **self-contained** with:
- **Data loading** from the shared utilities
- **Specialized analysis** functions
- **Comprehensive visualizations**
- **Statistical testing** and significance analysis
- **Summary insights** and next steps

### **5. Technical Implementation**

- **Modular design** with shared utilities
- **Arabic text handling** with proper Unicode processing
- **Statistical rigor** with appropriate tests
- **Scalable analysis** for all 114 surahs
- **Error handling** and data validation

The project is now ready for execution! Each notebook can be run independently to perform the specific analysis, and all results will contribute to testing the hypothesis that Muqatta'at function as checksums for Quranic text validation.
