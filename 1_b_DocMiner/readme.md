## DocMiner

This application indexes text documents and allow related information retrieval.

The motivation for this application was triggered by the need (at the university) to rewrite information into different documents structures. The idea is to provide the application with details about a required document i.e. content and structure, and the application will search its indexed database and search the internet to find related information. Then it will write the required document accordingly.

For searching the Internet the application might use some google search service, then it will need to read the webpage using sellinium or Microsoft Playright.

The application will use Agentic Framework e.g. CrewAI to achieve its objectives.
