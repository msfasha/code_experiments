The **EPANET-Python Toolkit (EPyT)** is an open-source software, originally developed by the `KIOS Research and Innovation Center of Excellence, University of Cyprus <http://www.kios.ucy.ac.cy/>`_ which operates within the Python environment, for providing a programming interface for the latest version of `EPANET <https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/epanet>`_, a hydraulic and quality modeling software created by the US EPA, with Python, a  high-level technical computing software. The goal of the EPANET Python Toolkit is to serve as a common programming framework for research and development in the growing field of smart water networks.

The **EPANET-Python Toolkit** features easy to use commands/wrappers for viewing, modifying, simulating and plotting results produced by the EPANET libraries.
