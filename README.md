## Code Experiments Folder

The folders in this directory contain my projects thoughts, these projects can be categorized into three categories (Business, Education and Research).
The projects are further organized by their priority level: current, next, and later.

The organization is designed to help me manage and focus on my projects effectively.
It is reflected in the folder naming convention.

The organization structure is as follows:
Each folder name starts with a number and a character according to the following:
- A number that determines the priority level (1 = current, 2 = next, 3 = later)
- A character that determines the projects domain (b = Business, e = Education, r = Research)

Examples:
- 1_b: Current and active engagement, high-priority business project.
- 2_e: Next-phase educational project.
- 3_r: Later-stage research project.


Each folder includes a readme file that clarifies the initial goals of the project.
