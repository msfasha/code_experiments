### The Prompt
I want to create a web application (express js and socket io) that allows clients to open chat/support sessions with an organization.
the orgnization can have a number of agents to receive these chats and handle them .

The client application (react js for now, mobile app in future) can talk to different organizations hosted at the server-side, the client interogates a central directory to detemine the correct organization he wants to initiate the chat session with.

The client app shows the typing feature like in whatsapp.

The chats are stored/partitioned in a casandar database according the the organization id.

The application shall be developed using containers, for the front end and the back end

The clients and the server shall be communicating using https i.e. encrypted connections

You thoughts please

### The Main Users Mode
The application will provide the following schemes for messaging:
1- Individual to an Organization --> Encrypted Tunnel
2- Organization to an Individual --> Encrypted Tunnel
3- Organization to an Organization --> Encrypted Tunnel
4- Individual to an Individual --> End to End Encryption between the two proxy servers hosting the clients profile
---

### Monetizing the Product
The payment scheme may include:
Individuals sunscribe to do group search
Companies subscribe to get high ranking in search
---

### User Requirements
- Oranizations can have have multiple messaging groups i.e. dispatch groups. The message group can be reached via the search and the description of roles
attached to that group, the AI agent shall determine which group to return or recommend to the user, or may be it can route it internally?!
- User mailbox can be internal or external, nevertheless, chatting with an organization is tunnel encrypted, chatting with an individual is e2e encrypted using signal protocol.
- Incorporate user/agent typing functionality
- Incorporate the single and double checkmarks functioanlity

---
### **Notes:**
Ctrl + Alt + V to paste images, move the image and modify the path if it is not done automatically
- Interesting method to implement acknowledgements, a callback function sent from the client to the server?!

I asked Cursor IDE AI Agent to tell me what does it understand from this code base, and this below was its answer:

I'll examine your codebase to understand your application architecture and functionality. Let me start by exploring the key components systematically.

Based on my comprehensive analysis of your codebase, here's what I understand about your application:

## **Raasel - Multi-Tenant Customer Support Chat Platform**

### **Core Architecture**

Your application is a **multi-tenant customer support chat platform** with the following key characteristics:

#### **1. Multi-Tenant Design**
- **Organizations** can register and have their own isolated chat environments
- Each organization has its own **domain** and **settings**
- **Agents** belong to specific organizations and can only handle chats for their organization
- **Sessions** are scoped to organizations for complete isolation

#### **2. Hybrid Database Architecture**
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores metadata (organizations, agents, sessions)
- **Cassandra**: Stores chat messages with organization-based partitioning
- **Redis**: Real-time state management and session mapping
- This design optimizes for both relational data and high-volume message storage

#### **3. Real-Time Communication**
- **Socket.IO** for real-time messaging
- **Typing indicators** (like WhatsApp)
- **Agent assignment** with round-robin load balancing
- **Session status management** (waiting, active, closed)

### **User Roles & Workflows**

#### **Clients (End Users)**
- Can initiate chat sessions with organizations
- Real-time messaging with typing indicators
- Session history and persistence
- Authentication system with JWT tokens

#### **Agents (Support Staff)**
- **Three roles**: agent, supervisor, admin
- **Status management**: active, inactive, busy
- **Session assignment** based on availability
- **Organization-scoped** access

#### **Organizations (Tenants)**
- **Customizable settings** (theme, welcome messages)
- **Domain-based routing**
- **Agent management**
- **Session monitoring**

### **Technical Implementation**

#### **Backend (Node.js/Express)**
- **RESTful API** for CRUD operations
- **Socket.IO** for real-time features
- **JWT authentication** with bcrypt password hashing
- **Rate limiting** and security headers
- **Graceful shutdown** handling

#### **Frontend (React)**
- **Authentication system** (login/register)
- **Main chat interface** with session management
- **Chat widget** for embedded support
- **Real-time updates** via Socket.IO client

#### **Infrastructure (Docker)**
- **Microservices architecture** with separate containers
- **Nginx** reverse proxy with SSL termination
- **Cassandra** for scalable message storage
- **PostgreSQL** for relational data
- **Redis** for caching and real-time state

### **Key Features**

1. **Multi-Organization Support**: Each organization has isolated data and agents
2. **Real-Time Messaging**: Instant message delivery with typing indicators
3. **Agent Assignment**: Automatic assignment of available agents to waiting sessions
4. **Session Management**: Complete lifecycle from creation to closure
5. **Security**: HTTPS, JWT tokens, password hashing, rate limiting
6. **Scalability**: Cassandra for message storage, Redis for real-time state
7. **Monitoring**: Health check endpoints and comprehensive logging

### **Business Model Alignment**

Your implementation aligns well with the requirements document:
- ✅ **Multi-tenant** organization support
- ✅ **Real-time** messaging with typing indicators
- ✅ **Cassandra** for message storage with organization partitioning
- ✅ **Containerized** deployment
- ✅ **HTTPS** communication
- ✅ **Agent assignment** and session management

### **Areas for Enhancement**

Based on your requirements, you might consider adding:
1. **Search functionality** for organizations
2. **Message acknowledgments** (read receipts)
3. **Group messaging** capabilities
4. **AI-powered routing** for message groups
5. **End-to-end encryption** for individual chats
6. **Payment/subscription** system integration

Your codebase is well-structured and follows modern best practices for a production-ready chat platform!
